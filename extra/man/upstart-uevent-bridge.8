.SH NAME
upstart\-uevent\-bridge \- Bridge between Upstart and uevent kobjects
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upstart\-uevent\-bridge
.RI [ OPTIONS ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B upstart\-uevent\-bridge
receives information about kernel uevents that
.BR netlink (7)
has completed and creates
.BR init (8)
events for them.

It emits events which match the pattern "\fIS\fP\-device\-\fIA\fP" where
\(aqS\(aq is the uevent \fIsubsystem\fP and \(aqA\(aq is one of
\fIadded\fR, \fIchanged\fR or \fIremoved\fR,
which correspond to the past tense of the uevent kobject \(aqaction\(aq.

See \fBnetlink\fP(7) for further details.

Assuming \fI/sys\fP is mounted, possible values for \fIsubsystem\fP for
your system are viewable via \fI/sys/class/\fP.
